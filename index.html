			<div class="panel-body">
				<div class="alert alert-success"><strong>Very likely that this is true</strong></div>
				<div class="well"><b>All recorded uses of the Trace in the <i>Harry Potter</i> Books</b><br></br>
				Mad-Eye Moody says "the trace detects magical activity around under-seventeens" (<i>Hallows</i>). <br></br>
				Dumbledore says that the Trace detects where the magic is coming from, but not who performed it (<i>Prince</i>). <br></br>
				Nymphadora Tonks performs spells like "Scourgify" and "Locomotor Trunk" after Harry has been expelled from Hogwarts (<i>Order</i>). <br></br>
				Mad-Eye Moody performs a disillusionment charm on Harry then too (<i>Order</i>). <br></br>
				Dumbledore conjures up a chair and offers the Dursleys floating magical mead (<i>Prince</i>). <br></br>
				Mad-Eye and Tonks was/is a ministry official (Auror) and Dumbledore is the chief warlock of the Wizengamot (<i>Goblet</i>). <br></br>
				The Imperius Curse was used by Barty Crouch Sr. (a ministry official) numerous times at his estate (<i>Goblet</i>). 
</div>
				<p><b>Theory</b><br></br>The Trace does not work at all for important or high ranking ministry officials. 
				If the Ministry were to fall, the officials would not want themselves or their Aurors 
				to be tracked by location. Because aurors fight dark wizards and remain mysterious, so
				it makes sense that their magic is not tracked. They were also given permission to use
				unforgivable curses during the First Wizarding War and after to catch remaining Death 
				Eaters. The Ministry wouldn't want to mistake an Auror for a criminal, then send Aurors
				at their own Aurors, so they removed the Trace from their Aurors. Dumbledore was reinstated
				as Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot in mid-1995, and this magic referenced was conducted 
				in late-1995, so because he is a high ranking official in the Ministry, Order of Merlin
				First Class holder, and Headmaster of Hogwarts, his magic was not tracked. Barty Crouch 
				worked in an extremely high ranking position at the ministry, so if the Ministry could see
				someone was performing an Imperius Curse in his house every so often, why wouldn't they 
				check out the scene? Itâ€™s because they can't see that the Imperius Curse is being performed
				at his house. </p>
