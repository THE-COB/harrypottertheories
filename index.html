				<div class="alert alert-success"><strong>Very likely that this is true</strong></div>
				<div class="well"><strong>All recorded uses of the Trace in the <i>Harry Potter</i> Books</strong><br></br>
				Mad-Eye Moody says "the trace detects magical activity around under-seventeens" (<i>Hallows</i>). <br></br>
				Dumbledore says that the Trace detects where the magic is coming from, but not who performed it (<i>Prince</i>). <br></br>
				Nymphadora Tonks performs spells like "Scourgify" and "Locomotor Trunk" after Harry has been expelled from Hogwarts (<i>Order</i>). <br></br>
				Mad-Eye Moody performs a disillusionment charm on Harry then too (<i>Order</i>). <br></br>
				Dumbledore conjures up a chair and offers the Dursleys floating magical mead (<i>Prince</i>). <br></br>
				Mad-Eye and Tonks was/is a ministry official (Auror) and Dumbledore is the chief warlock of the Wizengamot (<i>Goblet</i>). <br></br>
				The Imperius Curse was used by Barty Crouch Sr. (a ministry official) numerous times at his estate (<i>Goblet</i>). 
</div>
				<p><strong>Theory</strong><br></br>The Trace does not work at all for important or high ranking ministry officials. 
				If the Ministry were to fall, the officials would not want themselves or their Aurors 
				to be tracked by location. Because aurors fight dark wizards and remain mysterious, so
				it makes sense that their magic is not tracked. They were also given permission to use
				unforgivable curses during the First Wizarding War and after to catch remaining Death 
				Eaters. The Ministry wouldn't want to mistake an Auror for a criminal, then send Aurors
				at their own Aurors, so they removed the Trace from their Aurors. Dumbledore was reinstated
				as Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot in mid-1995, and this magic referenced was conducted 
				in late-1995, so because he is a high ranking official in the Ministry, Order of Merlin
				First Class holder, and Headmaster of Hogwarts, his magic was not tracked. Barty Crouch 
				worked in an extremely high ranking position at the ministry, so if the Ministry could see
				someone was performing an Imperius Curse in his house every so often, why wouldn't they 
				check out the scene? It’s because they can't see that the Imperius Curse is being performed
				at his house. </p>

				<div class="alert alert-success"><strong>Likely that this is true</strong></div>
				<div class="well"><strong>Background Information about the Marauder's Map</strong><br></br>
					One, the map has Homunculus charm to track every person inside Hogwarts. (<a href="https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/the-marauders-map" target="_blank">"Pottermore: The Marauder's Map"</a>). <br></br>
					Two, Fred, George, and Harry never once see Percy or Ron being followed by Peter Pettigrew (<i>Prisoner</i>). <br></br>
					Three, the map shows the position of Mrs. Norris, Filch's cat (not human, and not an Animagus) (<i>Prisoner</i>). <br></br>
					Four, the map (presumably) does not show the position of any other animals, specifically the Basilisk. <br></br>
					Five, the map was "also enchanted to forever repel (as insultingly as possible) the curiosity of their nemesis, Severus Snape" (<i>Hogwarts: An Incomplete and Unreliable Guide</i> 30).</div>
			<p><strong>Theory</strong><br></br>
			Tactically speaking, if someone were to hear James, Sirius, Remus, or Peter say “I solemnly swear I am up to no good” to a 
			piece of parchment and then found said piece of parchment, they would be able to track everyone. James, Sirius, and Peter 
			are all illegally Animagi, so if someone were to track them while they were in their Animagus form, it could spell big trouble 
			for them. Additionally, as Lupin is a Werewolf in a school, it could be problematic if someone tracked him to the Whomping Willow
			and then heard the howls. Therefore, it is extremely likely that the Marauders were untrackable when they were in their Animagus form. 
			The first question is: “would they be able to do this?” The Homunculus charm only tracks HUMANS, yet Mrs. Norris is on the map and J.K.
			Rowling has confirmed Mrs. Norris is not a special cat (malidictus, animagus). Therefore, the Marauders somehow configured the map to 
			also track one animal in the castle. Based on this, it seems very likely that the Marauders would exclude their animal forms from the 
			tracking. This would explain why Peter Pettigrew escapes Fred and George’s notice and why Snape could only see Sirius and Remus (not Peter)
			in the Shrieking Shack. By the way, this is going off of the books, not the movies, so Harry never sees Peter as a rat. However, there is 
			one more question. How does Lupin see Peter in his Animagus Form? We know that the map is sentient in some ways because it recognizes when
			Snape is using it and insults him; it is very likely that when a Marauder uses the map, the other marauders can be seen even when they are 
			in their animagus form.</p>
